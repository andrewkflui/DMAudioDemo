<h2>Audio File Playback</h2>
    <p>Developed by Dr. Andrew Kwok-Fai LUI</p>
<p>Learning Objective: Associate the auditable sound and the audio waveform</p>
<p>The Audio File Playback Application can play AU and WAV audio files.  Load the audio
  file welcome-1.wav.  The first 0.5 second has no voice and you can see there are minor
  fluctuations in the waveform.  These fluctuations are noises.
</p>
<p>After 0.575 seconds, the voice appeared and you should see that the amplitude of the
  waveform matches the voice level
