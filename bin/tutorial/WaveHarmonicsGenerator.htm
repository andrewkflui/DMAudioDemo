<h2>Wave Harmonics Generator</h2>
    <p>Developed by Dr. Andrew Kwok-Fai LUI</p>
<p>Learning Objective: Describe the audio effect of adding harmonics to a base 
  frequency </p>
<p>Harmonics give richness and varieties to a musical note. Harmonics is one reason 
  why different instruments sound differently. This learning object offers four 
  harmonics at 1x, 2x, 3x, and 4x the base frequency. Adjust the amplitude of 
  the harmonics and listen to the different audio effect. You should notice that 
  without the harmonics, the signal sounds more dry and simple. </p>
