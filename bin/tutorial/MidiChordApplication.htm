<h2>Midi Chord</h2>
    <p>Developed by Dr. Andrew Kwok-Fai LUI</p>
<p>Learning Objective: Explain the differences in the perception of various chords</p>
<p>Chords are notes played together. Chords are the basis of musical arrangement 
  and they are used to give sentiment and flow to the melody.</p>
<p>Chords are made up of a base note and other higher notes. Some chords give 
  you a feeling of completeness, and others give you a feeling of suspended. This 
  learning object allows you to experience these feelings.</p>
<p>Select a base note on the left combo box. Then select a chord type from the 
  right combo box. Play the chord. Change to another chord type with the base 
  note unchanged. Play the chord and compare it to the earlier one.</p>
<p>Base note = x</p>
<p>Major x, x + 4, x + 7 </p>
<p>Minor x, x + 3, x + 7 </p>
<p>Augmented x, x + 4, x + 8 </p>
<p>Diminished x, x + 3, x + 6 </p>
<p>Sus2 x, x + 5, x + 7 </p>
<p>Sus4 x, x + 2, x + 7 </p>
<p>Seventh x, x + 4, x + 7, x +10 </p>
<p>Major Seventh x, x + 4, x + 7, x +11 </p>
<p>Minor Seventh x, x + 3, x + 7, x +10 </p>
