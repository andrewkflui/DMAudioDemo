<h2>Quantization Demo</h2>
    <p>Developed by Dr. Andrew Kwok-Fai LUI</p>
<p>Learning Objective: Describe how the change in sample size distorts audio waveform 
  and degrades sound quality.</p>
<p>The data size of an audio sample is related to the fine-ness of the representation 
  in quantization of audio signal. An 8-bit audio sample can represent 256 levels 
  of audio signal amplitude. A 24-bit can represent 2^24 levels. A 24-bit sample 
  can represent audio signal's amplitude more accurately and the resulting audio 
  data is of a higher quality.</p>
<p>Use sine waveform and set frequency to around 600Hz in the Wave Generator. 
  Listen to the sound and consider it as the standard quality. The current sample 
  size is 8-bit, which represents 256 different quantization levels.</p>
<p>The Finer and Coarser buttons provide control of the sampling data size. Pressing 
  the Coarser button once will reduce the sample data size. The sample data size 
  is shown in the green window. After each change in the sampling rate, listen 
  the sound and compare the quality. The sound quality will soon become noticeably 
  poor.</p>
<p>The loudness also changes with the change in sampling data size because of 
  the severe distortion. Check out waveform.</p>
<p>Study the waveforms at different sampling data sizes. There are 8 levels between 
  the highest amplitude position and the lowest amplitude position when the sampling 
  rate is 3-bit. Change the amplitude slider between maximum and minimum, and 
  the levels would become clear.<br>
