<h2>Resampling Demo</h2>
    <p>Developed by Dr. Andrew Kwok-Fai LUI</p>
<p>Learning Objective: Describe how the change in sampling rate distorts audio waveform
  and degrades sound quality.
</p>
<p>The Resampling Demo contains a Waveform Generator and a Re-sampling Module that can
change the sampling rate of an audio signal.
The original signal is sampled at 44100Hz (there are 44100 samples per second).</p>
<p>Note the difference between sampling frequency and audio frequency.
Sampling frequency is the number of samples taken per second.
Audio frequency refers to how the amplitude changes in from one sample to the next sample.</p>
<p>The Up-sample and Down-sample buttons provide control of the sampling rate.
  Pressing the Down-sample once will halve the sampling rate.
  After each change in the sampling rate, listen the sound and compare the quality.
  At a certain low sampling frequency the sound quality will become noticeably poor.
  Note down this threshold sampling rate under which the audio quality is very poor.
</p>
<p>
Adjust the audio frequency of the wave generator.
Repeat the above and find out the threshold sampling rate for poor quality for different audio frequency.
There should be a relation.
</p>
<p>Study the waveform when poor audio quality is noticed.
  You should see a severe distortion in the output signal due to the lower sampling rate.
  Fewer samples are taken per second and so the signals are not truly represented.
