<h2>Midi Musical Instrument</h2>
    <p>Developed by Dr. Andrew Kwok-Fai LUI</p>
<p>Learning Objective: Explain the differences of the sound of musical instruments 
  are related to the waveform and the frequency spectral characteristics.</p>
<p>The Midi Instrument Demo uses the sound card capability of the computer to 
  generate musical notes of different instruments. There are two panels. The left 
  panel allows you to select one or more musical notes. The notes towards the 
  bottom are of the higher pitches. The right panel allows you to select one or 
  more musical instruments.</p>
<p> Select the musical note C4 and the musical instrument of violin. Press the 
  Play button to start playing the sound. </p>
<p>The two windows below show the waveform and the frequency domain information. 
  Pay attention to the different waveforms produced by different instruments.</p>
<p>The spectral analysis is based on software approximation and it is not quite 
  accurate. It is however sufficient to see the distribution of the harmonics.</p>
<p> Press stop and then select another musical note of a higher pitch and study 
  the frequency domain information again after pressing the Play button. The spikes 
  should have moved to the right, indicating higher frequencies. </p>
<p> Try other more well known musical instrument such as flute, trumpet, and harmonica. 
  Play these instruments at the same musical note. The waveforms of the sounds 
  of these instruments are different and so they sound differently even at the 
  same musical note. The frequency domain information can be more revealing, with 
  harmonics at different strengths and changing at different time.<br>
