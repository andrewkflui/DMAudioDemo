<h2>Frequency Masking Demo</h2>
    <p>Developed by Dr. Andrew Kwok-Fai LUI</p>
<p>Learning Objective: Describe the effect of frequency masking.</p>
<p>NOTE: Some students may not be able to experience the masking effect because 
  of the sensitivity of their ears. Please ignore this activity.</p>
<p>The interface provides controls to two waveform generator. We will use Generator 
  A to output the main audio signal, and Generator B to output a weaker signal 
  that is going to be masked.</p>
<p>Set Generator A to frequency of around 1000 Hz and the Amplitude to 50%.</p>
<p>Set Generator B to frequency of around 200 Hz and the Amplitude to 5%. You 
  should be able to barely hear the lower frequency audio signal. </p>
<p>Gradually increase the frequency of Generator B to around 800 Hz. You should 
  still be able to hear that there are two frequencies. Increase the frequency 
  of Generator B further and suddenly there should be a point that you cannot 
  hear the lower frequency audio signal. Note that frequency down. This frequency 
  should be around 820 Hz, but it could be different in your case. </p>
<p>Now set Generator B to 1000 Hz. Increase the frequency gradually until you 
  can hear a higher frequency sound. Again, note the frequency down.</p>
<p>You have now written down two frequencies. The range of frequency between the 
  two is the region that is masked by the 1000 Hz audio signal.<br>
