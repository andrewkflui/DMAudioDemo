    <h2>Low Pass Filter and Aliasing Demo</h2>
            <p>Developed by Dr. Andrew Kwok-Fai LUI</p>
    <p>You should now see an image scaled-up from a small version.
    The "blockiness" is due to the nearest-neighbour scaling up operation that
    simply copies a pixel's value to the gap after enlarge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The "blockiness" is an effect called aliasing. From the perspective of
      "rate of change", the "blockiness" is a high frequency (fast rate of change)
      signal.
    </p>
    <p>Human eyes are sensitive to lines and so the "blockiness" is the most
    prominent feature seen by you.</p>
    <p>A low-pass filter can filter out some of the high frequency signal. </p>
    <p>Pressing the button will perform a low-pass filter on the image and the
    blockiness will be removed.</p>
