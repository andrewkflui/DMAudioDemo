<h2>Wave Generator</h2>
    <p>Developed by Dr. Andrew Kwok-Fai LUI</p>
<p>Learning Objective: Describe the audio experience of high and low audio frequency 
  signals</p>
<p>The Wave Generator can generate sound of different audio frequencies. Adjust
  the frequency slider (FREQ) to 200 Hz and listen to the sound. This frequency 
  is around that of human voice. Compare to the sound of the frequency 1200 Hz. 
</p>
<p>Study the waveform of different frequencies. The amplitude change is quicker 
  if the audio frequency is higher. Change the frequency slider and look at how 
  the waveform changes.<br>
